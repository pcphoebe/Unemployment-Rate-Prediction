# Using Google Trends Keywords to Predict Unemployment Rate

**Description**

This repository includes the code and slide decks for a group project on time series. The goal of the project was to identify keywords that would be best predictors of the unemployment rate. Thus, 2 time series data were analyzed: monthly search frequencies of pre-chosen keywords from Google Trends and the U.S. unemployment rate. Then various forecasting models, including Simple Forecasting methods, Exponential Smoothing models, ARIMA models, and Neural Networks, were used to predict changes in the unemployment rate. My team and I found that the keywords "jobs" and "salary" were the best keyword predictor while, suprisingly, "unemployment" was the worst predictor.
